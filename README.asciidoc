Welcome to *Protocol23: Mechanism of Exalted Publication*!

This repository contains the *protocol23* SCons-based toolkit, for building
books which are similar in form and appearance to the *Exalted* (2nd edition)
range of books by White Wolf.

For the moment these tools have only been tested on my machine (Mac OS 10.6),
but should be usable on other Unix-alike systems with a little work.

While I regard my part of this work as Public Domain / Kopyleft there are, as
ever, some legal restrictions.  Being partly a derived work based on White
Wolf's intellectual property, anyone (other than them) who tries to sell this
is liable to hear from their lawyers.  On the other hand, some of the
resources I've used--fonts and hyphenation information--are subject to ``open
source'' licenses.  In particular, the OFFO hyphenation library contains files
which must be renamed if modified.
